0.00 2.04 Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
2.32 3.22 by Lewis Carroll
3.70 4.71 CHAPTER I.
5.00 6.19 Down the Rabbit-Hole
7.05 10.46 Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
10.74 12.13 and of having nothing to do:
12.52 15.20 once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading,
15.38 17.71 but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
18.00 19.68 “and what is the use of a book,”
19.92 23.17 thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
23.30 27.71 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
27.83 32.03 for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
32.68 35.18 whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain
35.33 39.21 would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
39.66 44.12 when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
44.42 47.38 There was nothing so very remarkable in that;
47.70 50.61 nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way
50.62 52.79 to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
53.07 54.08 “Oh dear!
54.08 54.64 Oh dear!
54.64 55.80 I shall be late!”
55.80 57.72 (when she thought it over afterwards,
57.72 61.32 it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
61.32 64.51 but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
65.36 70.16 but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket,
70.16 71.24 and looked at it,
71.24 73.32 and then hurried on,
73.32 75.16 Alice started to her feet,
75.16 78.41 for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen
78.41 80.76 a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket,
80.76 83.12 or a watch to take out of it,
83.12 84.96 and burning with curiosity,
84.96 87.20 she ran across the field after it,
87.20 90.36 and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down
90.36 93.04 a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
93.04 95.96 In another moment down went Alice after it,
95.96 100.16 never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.
100.16 103.12 The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
103.12 104.92 and then dipped suddenly down,
104.92 109.84 so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself
109.84 113.80 before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
113.80 116.04 Either the well was very deep,
116.04 117.52 or she fell very slowly,
117.52 121.12 for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her
121.12 123.32 and to wonder what was going to happen next.
123.32 124.20 First,
124.20 127.08 she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to,
127.08 129.84 but it was too dark to see anything;
129.84 131.76 then she looked at the sides of the well,
131.76 135.80 and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
135.80 140.08 here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
140.08 142.76 She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed;
142.76 145.36 it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”,
145.36 148.72 but to her great disappointment it was empty:
148.72 152.40 she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath,
152.40 156.12 so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
156.12 157.24 “Well!”
157.24 158.84 thought Alice to herself,
158.84 160.88 “after such a fall as this,
160.88 163.64 I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!
163.64 166.00 How brave they’ll all think me at home!
166.00 166.48 Why,
166.48 168.20 I wouldn’t say anything about it,
168.20 170.60 even if I fell off the top of the house!”
170.60 173.20 (Which was very likely true.)
173.20 174.12 Down,
174.12 175.60 down,
175.60 178.32 down.
178.32 181.16 Would the fall never come to an end?
181.16 184.60 “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?”
184.60 185.52 she said aloud.
185.52 189.00 “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
189.00 190.00 Let me see:
190.00 192.48 that would be four thousand miles down,
192.48 193.40 I think—”
193.40 194.04 (for,
194.04 194.80 you see,
194.80 198.28 Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom,
198.28 202.80 and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge,
202.80 204.64 as there was no one to listen to her,
204.64 207.76 still it was good practice to say it over)
207.76 209.12 “—yes,
209.12 210.68 that’s about the right distance —
210.68 213.96 but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?”
213.96 217.40 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
217.40 218.56 or Longitude either,
218.56 221.48 but thought they were nice grand words to say.)
221.48 223.56 Presently she began again.
223.56 226.32 “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
226.32 229.08 How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people
229.08 230.80 that walk with their heads downward!
230.80 233.12 The Antipathies,
233.12 233.80 I think—”
233.80 236.52 (she was rather glad there was no one listening,
236.52 237.40 this time,
237.40 240.04 as it didn’t sound at all the right word)

0.00 3.24 “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is,
3.24 3.60 you know.
3.60 4.68 Please,
4.68 5.20 Ma’am,
5.20 7.24 is this New Zealand or Australia?”
7.24 10.04 (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke —
10.04 13.32 fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air!
13.32 14.84 Do you think you could manage it?)
14.84 18.52 “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!
18.52 19.48 No,
19.48 21.36 it’ll never do to ask:
21.36 23.84 perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”
23.84 25.04 Down,
25.04 26.24 down,
26.24 28.12 down.
28.12 29.52 There was nothing else to do,
29.52 31.76 so Alice soon began talking again.
31.76 34.44 “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night,
34.44 35.20 I should think!”
35.20 36.56 (Dinah was the cat.)
36.76 40.00 “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
40.40 41.64 Dinah my dear!
41.64 43.80 I wish you were down here with me!
43.80 45.12 There are no mice in the air,
45.12 46.12 I’m afraid,
46.12 47.40 but you might catch a bat,
47.40 48.60 and that’s very like a mouse,
48.60 49.36 you know.
49.36 50.56 But do cats eat bats,
50.56 51.60 I wonder?”
51.60 54.44 And here Alice began to get rather sleepy,
54.44 56.08 and went on saying to herself,
56.08 57.60 in a dreamy sort of way,
57.60 61.04 “Do cats eat bats?
61.04 64.14 Do cats eat bats?”
64.34 65.44 and sometimes,
65.44 68.72 “Do bats eat cats?”
68.72 69.16 for,
69.16 70.28 you see,
70.28 72.68 as she couldn’t answer either question,
72.68 75.68 it didn’t much matter which way she put it.
75.68 77.88 She felt that she was dozing off,
77.88 81.96 and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah,
81.96 83.84 and saying to her very earnestly,
83.84 84.84 “Now,
84.84 85.24 Dinah,
85.24 86.64 tell me the truth:
86.64 88.56 did you ever eat a bat?”
88.56 89.32 when suddenly,
89.32 89.96 thump!
89.96 90.32 thump!
90.32 93.88 down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves,
93.88 95.96 and the fall was over.
95.96 97.64 Alice was not a bit hurt,
97.64 100.40 and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
100.40 101.52 she looked up,
101.52 103.52 but it was all dark overhead;
103.52 105.64 before her was another long passage,
105.64 107.64 and the White Rabbit was still in sight,
107.64 109.20 hurrying down it.
109.20 110.88 There was not a moment to be lost:
110.88 113.24 away went Alice like the wind,
113.24 115.12 and was just in time to hear it say,
115.12 116.28 as it turned a corner,
116.28 119.00 “Oh my ears and whiskers,
119.00 120.56 how late it’s getting!”
120.56 123.16 She was close behind it when she turned the corner,
123.16 125.12 but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:
125.12 127.08 she found herself in a long,
127.08 128.00 low hall,
128.00 131.20 which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
131.20 133.88 There were doors all round the hall,
133.88 135.44 but they were all locked;
135.44 138.88 and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
138.88 140.44 trying every door,
140.44 142.28 she walked sadly down the middle,
142.28 145.00 wondering how she was ever to get out again.
145.00 147.80 Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table,
147.80 149.60 all made of solid glass;
149.60 152.92 there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
152.92 155.12 and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong
155.12 156.48 to one of the doors of the hall;
156.48 157.24 but,
157.24 158.44 alas!
158.44 159.96 either the locks were too large,
159.96 161.48 or the key was too small,
161.48 165.32 but at any rate it would not open any of them.
165.32 165.84 However,
165.84 167.08 on the second time round,
167.08 170.00 she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before,
170.00 173.72 and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high:
173.72 176.40 she tried the little golden key in the lock,
176.40 179.04 and to her great delight it fitted!
179.04 183.08 Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage,
183.08 185.36 not much larger than a rat-hole:
185.36 187.56 she knelt down and looked along the passage
187.56 189.96 into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
189.96 193.28 How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
193.28 198.32 and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains,
198.32 201.32 but she could not even get her head through the doorway;
201.32 203.76 “and even if my head would go through,”
203.76 205.16 thought poor Alice,
205.16 208.92 “it would be of very little use without my shoulders.
208.92 209.44 Oh,
209.44 212.20 how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
212.20 213.32 I think I could,
213.32 214.96 if I only knew how to begin.”
214.96 215.48 For,
215.48 215.96 you see,
215.96 219.20 so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,
219.20 220.64 that Alice had begun to think
220.64 223.80 that very few things indeed were really impossible.
223.80 227.28 There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door,
227.28 228.92 so she went back to the table,
228.92 231.84 half hoping she might find another key on it,
231.84 235.64 or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes:
235.64 239.12 this time she found a little bottle on it,

6.30 11.75 6 minute English from BBC learning English
12.55 15.00 <v Neil> Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.
15.20 16.30 <v Georgina> And I'm Georgina.
16.40 20.65 <v Neil> In this programm we’re focussing on the topic of mental health at work.
20.90 23.80 <v Georgina> Yes, it’s an issue that can be difficult to see.
24.15 28.30 If someone has an injury, like a broken leg or a serious medical issue,
28.55 31.25 it’s obvious, and we can understand what’s happening.
31.55 33.25 With mental health issues, though,
33.55 37.45 there’s no physical sign and people who are experiencing difficulties
37.65 41.75 maybe don’t get the same understanding as people who have medical problems.
41.90 45.10 <v Neil> It’s a topic that has been getting more publicity recently,
45.20 49.10 particularly as members of the British royal family have been talking about it.
49.50 54.00 Also, awareness is raised through events such as World Mental Health Day.
54.05 56.05 And that is the topic of our quiz.
56.15 59.95 World Mental Health Day is held every year on October 10th.
60.15 62.85 It aims to raise awareness of mental health issues
63.05 64.20 and their effects
64.25 65.45 on people’s lives.
65.70 67.40 In what year was it first held?
67.45 69.45 Was it... A: 1992
69.50 71.30 B: 2002
71.45 73.05 C: 2012
73.10 74.00 What do you think, Georgina?
74.10 76.70 <v Georgina> I don’t know – I think it will be
76.85 78.45 older than 2012, but as old as 1992?
79.00 81.10 I don’t know.
81.15 83.15 I’m going to go
83.45 85.00 with 2002
85.00 87.61 <v Neil> OK. I’ll have the answer later in the programme
87.86 89.36 and we’ll see if you’re right.
89.61 93.86 Mental health problems are very difficult personally for those who suffer from them,
94.11 96.71 and they also have an impact on businesses.
97.06 101.46 Paul Farmer is head of the mental health awareness charity Mind.
101.66 105.71 He spoke on the BBC World Service Business Daily programme about this.
106.06 109.26 How much does he says it costs businesses in the UK?
110.46 115.56 <v Paul Farmer, CEO Mind>We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal.
115.61 120.26 In the UK, it costs between 33 and 42 billion pounds a year,
120.31 121.81 about $50 billion dollars,
121.86 126.76 and round about 300,000 people fall out of work every year
126.81 128.71 as a result of poor mental health.
128.76 132.81 So that’s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals.
132.96 135.86 Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of
136.26 137.91 talented, able,
138.01 139.11 contributors
139.11 141.66 who often just slide away from the workplace
141.76 145.01 because they don’t get the right help and support for their mental health.
146.51 148.46 <v Neil> What figures did Paul Farmer give there?
149.06 151.11 <v Georgina> He gave the figure of about between
151.16 154.11 33 and £42 billion pounds
154.46 156.51 – which is about $50 billion dollars.
156.51 157.86 <v Neil> That’s a lot of money!
158.11 160.71 <v Georgina> It is – in fact he called it colossal.
161.31 164.56 This adjective means huge – really, really big.
165.06 166.96 This is the cost to business he says of
167.01 169.31 failing to address the mental health issue.
169.51 173.06 <v Neil> Failing to address means ignoring or not dealing with the problems.
173.31 175.06 It leads to staff leaving work,
175.11 177.56 and he says these people are contributors,
177.61 181.41 they give something to the business in terms of their skill and experience.
181.71 183.66 <v Georgina> And because of mental health issues,
183.71 185.71 which could be addressed but aren’t,
185.86 188.66 those contributors are being lost to the business.
188.91 192.86 So it costs companies more money to recruit and train new staff,
193.16 195.96 and you can’t always replace the experience that is lost.
196.01 197.36 <v Neil> Let’s listen again.
198.46 203.56 <v Paul Farmer, CEO Mind>We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal.
203.61 208.26 In the UK, it costs between 33 and 42 billion pounds a year,
208.31 209.81 about $50 billion dollars,
209.86 214.76 and round about 300,000 people fall out of work every year
214.81 216.71 as a result of poor mental health.
216.76 220.81 So that’s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals.
220.96 223.86 Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of
224.26 225.91 talented, able,
226.01 227.11 contributors
227.11 229.81 who often just slide away from the workplace
229.81 232.96 because they don’t get the right help and support for their mental health.
233.42 238.09 <v Neil> In recent years it seems as if there has been more understanding of mental health issues,
238.12 241.16 not just in the workplace but in society as a whole.
241.60 245.35 Geoff McDonald is a campaigner for the organisation Minds at Work.
245.76 250.53 He spoke on the Business Daily programme about one way that things were getting a little better.
251.57 253.19 <v Geoff McDonald, Minds at Work> I think what’s really changed
253.33 254.95 is people telling their stories,
255.01 257.07 and the more stories that we tell
257.09 258.94 it kind of begins to normalise this.
259.15 261.00 Every single story that we tell
261.13 263.58 is like sending a lifeboat out into the ocean
263.80 265.90 and the millions and millions of people
265.94 267.49 who are suffering in silence,
267.52 268.36 do you know what they do?
268.71 270.30 They cling on to that lifeboat
270.43 271.80 and they realise
271.83 272.98 they’re not alone
273.08 274.82 and they might just be normal.
276.04 278.85 <v Neil> So, because more people are talking about this issue,
278.89 280.67 it begins to normalise it.
280.98 282.88 This means it becomes ‘normal’.
282.93 285.42 It’s not unusual, strange or hidden.
285.70 287.74 <v Georgina> There are people who suffer in silence –
287.83 290.76 they keep to themselves and hide their problems from others,
291.09 293.76 but because there is more publicity about this topic,
293.96 298.48 they can begin to feel that they are not alone and they don’t have to suffer in silence.
298.55 303.25 <v Neil> People sharing their stories are like lifeboats for those who do suffer in silence.
303.70 306.60 In this metaphor they can cling onto the lifeboats.
306.72 309.86 Right, we’re going to another look at today’s vocabulary,
309.89 310.68 but first
311.18 312.84 let’s have the answer to today’s quiz.
313.03 316.07 When was the first World Mental Health Day?
316.08 317.99 Was it... A. 1992
318.21 319.81 B: 2002
319.83 321.49 C: 2012
321.62 322.98 Georgina, what did you say?
323.26 325.08 <v Georgina> I thought it was 2002.
325.21 326.44 <v Neil> It was actually earlier -
326.45 327.66 1992.
327.75 329.84 Now, a review of our vocabulary.
330.44 331.47 <v Georgina> Failing to address
331.49 333.63 is a phrase that means ignoring a problem
333.64 335.45 or not trying to help with a problem.
335.83 338.46 <v Neil> Something colossal is very, very big.
338.90 341.37 <v Georgina> A contributor is someone who has something to give,
341.80 343.41 who is a positive benefit to,
343.43 345.07 in this case, a business.
345.46 349.18 <v Neil> Then we have the verb to normalise, meaning to make something normal.
349.73 351.37 <v Georgina> Someone who suffers in silence,
351.68 354.79 doesn’t talk about their problems and may hide them from others.
354.90 357.39 <v Neil> And finally, if you cling on to something,
357.68 359.06 you hold on to it tightly,
359.59 360.96 you don’t want to let it go.
361.63 363.32 And that’s all from us from this programme.
363.51 365.54 We look forward to your company again soon.
365.59 368.15 In the meantime find us online, on social media
368.37 370.02 and on the BBC Learning English app.
370.15 370.67 <v Georgina> Bye!

0.13 1.43 What is the deal with 5G?
1.79 4.84 And why are the U.S. and China going to war over it?
4.87 6.87 Well, we'll try and break it down for you
6.91 8.14 in our ongoing segment,
8.19 9.74 "If You Don't Know, Now You know."
9.82 13.01 -♪ ♪ -(cheering, applause)
18.95 22.55 So, what exactly is the big deal about 5G?
22.71 25.73 Because you might think it's just 4G but a little bit faster.
25.89 27.41 But it's actually a lot faster.
27.46 30.53 So fast, in fact, that it could change the world.
31.11 33.88 NEWSMAN: The new world of 5G technology promises
33.91 35.67 to transform our lives,
36.02 37.95 connecting millions of devices
38.09 40.82 and enabling everything from driverless cars
40.86 42.07 to smart homes.
42.15 43.86 Up to 20 times faster
43.95 46.10 than the 4G most of us use now,
46.26 48.70 5G's lightning-fast technology
48.78 51.37 will accelerate and interconnect everything.
51.48 53.95 To download a two-hour film on 3G
54.03 55.97 would take about 26 hours.
56.20 58.81 On 4G, you'd be waiting six minutes.
58.96 61.53 And on 5G, you'll be ready to watch your film
61.66 63.89 in just over three and a half seconds.
64.13 67.16 Damn. You could download an entire movie
67.42 68.94 in three seconds.
69.49 70.45 That's gonna be fast.
70.90 72.64 I mean, we'll still spend 45 minutes
72.67 74.59 trying to decide which movie to download...
75.45 77.04 but once we've decided,
77.56 79.70 we'll need to go to bed 'cause we're tired,
80.08 83.01 but tomorrow, three seconds, my friends!
84.64 87.10 And 5G isn't just about download speeds.
87.13 89.15 It's a game changer for everything.
89.16 91.30 Like, with 5G, you can have cities
91.31 92.79 where everything communicates.
92.89 94.63 Like, doctors can perform surgeries
94.69 95.86 from the other side of the world.
95.89 97.18 Can you imagine a world where
97.27 98.80 your videos never buffer?
98.95 100.85 Right? Your calls never drop?
100.96 102.30 That would be amazing.
102.64 103.33 Except
103.52 106.35 I guess now you could never fake a call dropping with 5G.
106.38 107.64 Yeah, 'cause that excuse is gone.
107.67 110.13 You'd be like, "Uh, uh, I'm los... I'm losing...
110.21 112.41 I'm lose, you're breaking up." Be like, "Mother (bleep),
112.45 113.98 you're not breaking up! We got 5G!"
115.53 117.13 Be like, "Yeah, yeah, you're right.
117.15 118.12 -Carry on, Grandma." -(laughter)
119.53 121.35 Yes, my grandma is Samuel L. Jackson.
121.40 123.17 -(laughter) -So...
123.76 125.87 so, look, there's no denying, the technology is great.
126.17 126.97 But...
127.25 129.95 why do China and the U.S. care so much about who makes it?
130.36 132.10 Well, it's the same reason they care about anything:
132.36 133.30 the Benjamins, baby.
133.95 137.18 NEWSMAN: When the U.S. won the 4G race earlier this decade,
137.24 140.24 it provided a nearly $100 billion boost
140.27 141.74 to gross domestic product.
141.79 144.67 And the stakes of the 5G race are even higher.
144.76 145.90 If the U.S. wins,
145.96 148.61 it would create an estimated three million jobs
148.66 152.38 and add approximately $500 billion to GDP.
152.52 154.85 That's right, if America wins the 5G race,
155.09 158.64 that could bring millions of jobs and $500 billion
158.84 159.89 to the country's GDP.
160.08 162.29 $500 billion.
162.49 164.98 You know how hard it is to get $500 billion?
165.06 168.27 Like, you'd have to marry and divorce Jeff Bezos five times.
168.30 169.72 -(laughter)
169.87 171.84 -And I mean after the fourth time, he'd probably catch on--
171.90 173.63 he'd be like, "I think you don't love me."
173.66 174.77 "What? Me, Jeff?"
176.86 179.36 And the fight about 5G isn't just about money
179.50 181.31 and downloading Avengers like that.
181.45 183.42 No, it's also about power.
183.83 185.77 Because if you control 5G,
186.14 187.17 you have access
187.27 189.57 to everything people are doing online,
190.15 190.99 which is everything.
191.37 192.28 And right now,
192.49 194.04 the best 5G technology
194.16 196.53 is made by a Chinese company called Huawei.
197.08 198.81 And because the Chinese company
199.35 200.60 is Chinese...
201.05 203.97 many governments don't trust how secure it's gonna be.
204.45 207.46 NEWSMAN: Huawei may be best known to most people for making phones,
207.69 209.46 but it's also a leading player
209.46 212.85 in building the infrastructure for all our communications.
213.21 216.09 Critics fear that allowing it to build 5G
216.30 218.67 could enable the Chinese state to spy on
218.75 221.17 or even switch off the flow of data
221.33 222.76 we will all depend on.
223.24 224.04 Imagine that.
224.42 226.72 If Huawei becomes the leading 5G provider in the world,
226.86 229.49 then China can spy on everyone,
229.94 230.71 which is terrible,
231.08 232.52 because that's what America wants to do.
233.70 234.82 Yeah. And I know you're judging.
234.85 237.99 "Well, if America wants to do it, then how do they judge...?" That's not the point,
238.27 238.78 all right.
238.98 239.92 You want to do it first.
239.95 241.47 It's like when you cut someone off in traffic
241.49 242.82 and then someone else cuts in front of you, you're like,
242.84 245.10 "Hey, asshole, that was my move!"
246.82 247.89 But those are the stakes:
248.06 248.51 job,
248.69 249.22 money
249.41 250.15 and power.
250.76 252.05 And I'm not gonna try and bore you
252.06 253.25 with all the technical details, but
253.49 255.99 while America is developing its own 5G,
256.43 259.20 China's 5G is so far ahead.
259.60 261.28 Like, they're basically gonna set the trends.
261.52 262.55 It's like how back in the day
262.70 264.41 there used to be a fight between DVD
264.68 265.58 and laser disk.
265.81 266.01 Yeah.
266.23 268.15 And if you're wondering, "What the hell is laser disk?"
268.20 269.17 Exactly, yeah.
269.75 270.96 That's America's 5G.
271.92 274.53 So this is a race many people are already saying America has lost.
275.30 275.84 Luckily--
276.00 277.71 and I can't believe I'm saying this--
278.16 279.94 America is lucky that you have
279.96 281.33 a maniac on your team
281.78 283.17 who's willing to play dirty.
283.69 286.23 President Trump has signed an executive order banning U.S.
286.26 287.50 companies from using
287.66 288.73 telecom equipment
288.86 290.72 deemed to be a national security threat.
290.75 292.25 And that's a direct shot at China
292.48 294.15 and its tech giant Huawei.
294.21 296.34 TV REPORTER: As the U.S. clamp down on the company causes
296.35 297.83 a major domino effect,
298.26 301.13 the U.K.'s biggest mobile network pulling Huawei
301.15 303.23 from its 5G launch,
303.33 307.19 while three of Japan's mobile operators have stopped taking orders,
307.28 309.64 or delayed the summer release of a new
309.66 310.80 Huawei phone.
311.26 311.79 Donald
311.96 313.51 J. Mother-effing-Trump.
315.10 317.39 This guy could see America wasn't gonna win,
317.41 318.92 so he just got a crowbar
319.08 321.68 and pulled a Tonya Harding on China's 5G.
322.25 323.77 Just went in straight there.
324.18 324.54 Yeah,
324.97 327.01 the man might not know what 5G is,
327.02 328.13 but he does know
328.55 330.39 how to mess up other people's shit.
330.40 331.61 Just in there.
333.20 333.95 Bam!
333.98 338.07 (cheers and applause)
338.17 339.45 And I'm gonna be honest with you.
339.52 341.06 I don't actually blame Donald Trump,
341.07 344.05 because I don't know how else America can win this race.
344.20 345.62 Because even if America does manage
345.62 347.10 to cripple Huawei and China,
347.21 349.68 it's not like America will suddenly have great 5G.
349.94 351.65 All right, you won't just have 5G overnight.
352.38 353.13 Unless...
353.76 354.71 America just
354.96 357.32 pretends that it does.
357.93 360.83 TV REPORTER: AT&T is putting a fake 5G logo
360.85 362.67 on iPhones and iPads now.
362.69 364.95 The company confirming to PC Magazine
364.97 367.60 the the new icon is gonna show up when users download
367.79 369.48 Apple's latest beta version
369.73 371.34 of iOS 12.2.
371.64 373.13 But it's not really 5G.
373.51 375.34 AT&T just changed the name for its
375.35 379.12 4G LTE Advanced network to 5GE.
379.28 381.20 The "e” stands for evolution.
381.55 384.16 (laughter)
384.24 385.37 Okay, guys, that...
386.04 386.86 That's really sad.
387.69 389.49 AT&T is just gonna lie and put another sticker--
389.51 391.24 Like, it's like you have a Smart car,
391.52 393.88 and then you just tape Lamborghini on the side of it.
394.77 395.85 "Check it out, man,
395.98 399.00 I'm driving a Lambo now. Zero to 60 in four minutes flat.”
401.18 401.87 But...
403.19 405.42 Seeing as it's a race that might be lost,
405.77 408.33 AT&T might be on to something here. Because
408.91 411.24 this is considered the new space race.
411.54 412.35 So maybe
412.70 415.77 America can win this race the same way it won the last one:
416.40 417.33 Just fake it, baby.

## timing

4.61 9.39 في عالم الخيل والإبل والبيداء ,كانت البداية.
10.73 12.75 فبداية الكلام العربي
12.91 15.19 لم تكن حبيسة فضاء,
15.41 20.79 بل استمر المسير واختلط الأثر ودام الرحيل,
21.53 25.37 فستعصى تقصي بصمات الأصل والأصيل.
28.85 32.31 تعددت الروافد والمعين واحد,
32.83 37.87 والمؤكد أن ميلاد اللغة العربية من رحم اللغات السامية,
38.21 41.99 يرجع إلى مئات القرون قبل بزوغ شمس الإسلام.
42.53 46.09 (music)
46.55 50.63 وقد اختلف الباحثون في تحديد موطن الساميين الأصلي,
51.07 53.93 ولم يصلوا فيه إلى رأي يقين,
54.43 59.81 ومن الأرجح أنه كان في القسم الجنوبي الغربي من شبه الجزيرة العربية,
60.17 64.31 خصوصا بلاد الحجاز ونجد واليمن.
64.67 67.11 نحن نقول إن اللغة العربية جزء من هذه
67.41 70.99 العائلة السامية التي تزيد على حوالي 25 لغة,
71.43 74.23 واللتي تمتد في الجغرافيا من القرن الإفريقي
74.73 75.97 حيث الأمهرية
76.33 77.47 والجعزية
77.89 78.99 واللغات
79.19 80.59 الحبشية القديمة
80.99 84.39 لكي تمتد في أقصى الشمال إلى العراق
84.63 87.13 حيث النبطية الآرامية السريانية.
98.23 102.33 ولغة العرب على تنوع مشاربها وتلون حللها,
102.73 105.07 ترجع إلى لغتين أصيلتين.
105.73 109.27 لغة القبائل العدنانية شمال الجزيرة العربية,
109.51 112.41 ولغة القبائل القحطانية جنوباً.
112.97 118.25 قبل الإسلام بسبعة قرون كانت العرب قبائل ,
118.41 119.83 شعوب وقبائل متفرقة,
120.15 121.79 كل منطقة تتكلم بلهجة,
122.27 127.55 هذه اللهجة مثلاً أهل الجنوب أهل قحطان في اليمن وما حولها,
127.85 129.79 أهل الشمال العدنانيون
130.55 136.23 كلٌ يتكلم بلهجته إلى جوار قبائل أذد وطيب وحمير.
136.37 138.11 قال أبو عمرو بن علاء
138.35 142.05 حينما أراد أن يتكلم عن الفرق بين الشمال والجنوب في اللغة .
142.25 145.91 قال ما لغة حمير بلغتنا
146.17 147.79 ولاعربيتهم بعربيتنا
152.77 155.07 كان للغة العربية القديمة
155.39 157.37 أكثر من مستوىً وظيفي,
157.99 159.37 اللغة المشتركة
159.75 164.57 وهي لغة الشعر والخطابة والحوار والمفاخرات من جهة,
165.03 166.39 ولغة القبائل
166.61 171.29 اللتي تتفاوت فصاحتها بمدى قربها من اللغة المشتركة.
172.21 176.37 وكان من الطبيعي أن طغت لغة الشمال على لغة الجنوب
176.67 179.57 ولغة قريش على سائر اللغات
179.81 183.83 لإعتبارات دينية واقتصادية واجتماعية.
184.25 186.09 بحكم أن قريش
186.65 188.79 كانت هي المشرفة على الحج,
189.49 191.77 وكون الحج كان أعظم سوق ديني,
192.29 193.59 موسم تجاري
194.43 195.45 ومحفل
195.77 198.11 يجتمع فيه العرب فيتبادلون فيه الآراء
198.53 202.57 ويحاولون أن يقربوا إلى بعضهم البعض لغة التفاهم
202.85 205.89 على قاعدة مشتركة هي لغة القوم اللذين يجدون عندهم.
212.25 214.47 رغم أنهم يختلفون في بعض الألفاظ ,
214.53 216.73 ولكن معظم العرب يعرفون
216.83 218.91 هذه اللهجة لأنهم يتواصلون
219.07 220.27 سنوياً مع
220.47 225.47 هذه القبيلة ولمكانتها اللتي كانت لها حتى قبل الإسلام.
225.77 228.07 ولهذا العرب في سوق الحج
228.79 232.95 وما جاوروا من أسواق كانوا يقتربون من بعضهم البعض على قاعدة
233.31 236.33 نطق قريش على قاعدة لهجة قريش على قاعدة
236.53 239.01 نمط قريش في التعبير وفي الأداء الصوتي
256.87 261.43 كان العرب يقيمون الأسواق للبيع والتجارة والتبادل,
261.61 263.91 وتدعوهم طبيعة الاجتماع
264.07 265.71 إلى المقاربة في القول
265.91 267.43 والمقاربة في الرأي
267.77 269.37 والمبادهة في الشعر
269.63 271.53 والمباهاة بالبلاغة ,
271.85 273.81 ويبقى سوق عكاظ
273.85 278.25 أفصحى تعبير عن احتفاء العرب بجمالية الكلم.
279.93 282.35 وتعد فترة ما قبل الإسلام
282.45 285.97 حلقة مهمة في تاريخ العربية الفصيحة
286.31 290.07 اللتي بلغت درجة غير مسبوقة من التطور.
290.73 291.73 العربية
291.95 294.31 في فترة ماقبل الإسلام
295.03 297.47 كانت تغلب عليها خصائص
297.85 300.55 اللغة الناشئة في بيئة الصحراء ,
301.33 305.13 من جهة هناك البساطة والحسيّة ,
306.01 307.57 ولهذا غلب على العرب
308.03 313.79 أسماء المحيط البيئي الطبيعي المحيط بهم فكانوا يتحدثون عن أنواع
314.17 316.97 من الجبال والكثبان والرمال
317.23 321.55 وحتى اللغة كانت تأخذ بعد حسّي فتغيب بها ألفاظ البعث واليوم الأخر
321.87 323.71 والغيب ,كلها عالم مجرد .
324.05 325.97 لا من جهة كون العبادة كانت حسّية
326.27 328.57 والعقيدة كانت وثنية ,ولا من جهة كون الفكر
329.15 333.95 فلسفي لم يكن متطوراً بحيث يسمح بأن تواكبه اللغة على مستوى جديد,
335.03 338.07 لكن العالم العاطفي المقابل كان عالم غني.
338.37 342.45 إنسان بدوي إنسان فطري تلقائي إنسان صادق في طبيعته .
